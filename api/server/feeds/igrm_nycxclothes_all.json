From the places we go, the clothes we wear, the causes we believe in, our dating adventures, we show it all and like to keep it real. Quite recently, we decided to launch an event series that we call NYCxClothes & Friends. It\\\\\\'s a curation of unconventional gatherings to get creatives to really connect with each other.
